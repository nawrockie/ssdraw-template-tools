- duplicate a nucleotide and then open XML Editor under the Edit menu
- name the nucleotide x.1, x.2, x.3...x.n if it comes after (3') of

Staring with an existing postscript template that is just the
incorrect length, and adjusting to the correct length. Incorrect
length is X desired length is Y.

This also works for adapting a different domain model, for example
starting with archaeal LSU and adapting to bacterial LSU.

1. Find CM-X and ssdraw template file SS-X that correspond to X.
2. Find CM-Y that corresponds to Y.
3. Emit consensus sequence from CM-Y and align to CM-X, then draw that
   with SS-X and look for inserts and deletes.
4. Convert SS-X to svg with ps2svg.pl
5. Adapt in inkscape as instructions above, save modified SVG as SVG file
6. Convert SVG back to ps with svg2ps.pl.
